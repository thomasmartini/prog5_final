<h1>csgo forum </h1>
<p>Code for a forum this one is specifically made for csgo but
it can be used for other projects with a few tweaks</p>
<h2>install</h2>
<p>This is a laravel app so it needs to be installed with composer
where after you need to change the database logic in the .env file to suit your needs<br>
also FILESYSTEM_DRIVER=public for the thumbnails to store to the right directory</p>
enjoy
